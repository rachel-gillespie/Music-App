Earl Scruggs (1924-2012) was an American banjo player who revolutionized the instrument with his innovative three-finger picking style, now known as "Scruggs style." This technique elevated the banjo from a rhythm instrument to a lead instrument, and became a defining characteristic of bluegrass music.

Here are some key highlights of his career:

Early Life: Born in North Carolina, Scruggs began playing banjo at a young age. He joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys in 1945, where he first gained widespread recognition.
Flatt and Scruggs: In 1948, he formed the hugely successful bluegrass duo Flatt and Scruggs with Lester Flatt. They recorded numerous classic bluegrass songs and introduced the genre to a wider audience through appearances in films and television shows like "The Beverly Hillbillies."
"Foggy Mountain Breakdown": This iconic instrumental, composed by Scruggs, became a bluegrass standard and was featured in the film "Bonnie and Clyde," further solidifying its place in popular culture.
Later Career: After Flatt and Scruggs disbanded in 1969, Scruggs continued to perform and record with his sons in the Earl Scruggs Revue, exploring a more progressive, country-rock sound.

Earl Scruggs' influence on the banjo and bluegrass music is immeasurable. He is considered one of the most important figures in the history of American roots music.
