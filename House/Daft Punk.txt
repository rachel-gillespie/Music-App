Daft Punk was a French electronic music duo formed in Paris in 1993 by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They are widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music history. 

Known for their innovative sound that fused house music with elements of funk, techno, disco, rock, and synthpop, Daft Punk rose to fame in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement. Their debut album, *Homework* (1997), was a critical and commercial success, featuring iconic tracks like "Around the World" and "Da Funk."

In 1999, the duo adopted their signature robot personas, donning helmets and gloves to conceal their identities and cultivate an air of mystery. This unique visual identity became synonymous with their music and further solidified their iconic status.

Daft Punk continued to push boundaries with their subsequent albums, *Discovery* (2001), *Human After All* (2005), and *Random Access Memories* (2013), each of which explored new sonic territories and further cemented their legacy as musical pioneers. 

The duo announced their disbandment in February 2021, leaving behind a rich and influential catalog that continues to inspire and captivate music lovers worldwide.
